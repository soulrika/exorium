# exorium privacy policy | since 2020
*Please note that the privacy policy can change at any given time. We will notify you if the privacy policy is changed in our [support server](https://discord.gg/CEHkNky)*
*We reserve the right to change this at any given time without notice however, and will sometimes change it without notification.*

## What information do you store and why?


We only store user information for the `warn`, `delwarn`, `warnings` and `suggest` commands:

the only information stored for those commands are the ID of the user and moderator, and the server ID.

We store this information so warnings are saved until deleted.
userid is used for the user that gets warned, and serverid for which case belongs to what server.
The data, rather warn(s) are deleted if a moderator in a server you got warned in deletes your warn(s) using the `delwarn` command or if an exorium developer removes the data.

`suggest` will only store the user ID. 

**NOTE: ONLY MAIN DEVELOPERS, AS WELL AS THE HOST & PROVIDER CAN ACCESS THE DATA.**

If exorium joins or leaves a guild it will log the following:
- The guild name
- The guild ID
- The membercount
- The owner username

If a command is executed on exorium it will log the following:
- The command executed
- The user#1234 that executed it
- The guild it was executed in
- The channel it was executed in

If an error occurs on exorium it will log the following:
- The error
- The user who did the command which caused the error

Guild joins/leaves and command executions/errors do **not** get saved. Only **logged**, these are only visible to members of the exorium team and happen only once everytime.

## third party sharing
We do **not** share anything with third parties, any data saved is only visible to (certain members of) the exorium team.


## questions and concerns
You can ask any questions or concerns in an issue, or you can join our [support server](https://discord.gg/CEHkNky) and ask. You can also DM [Bluewy](https://discord.com/users/698080201158033409) or [Toothless](https://discord.com/users/341988909363757057) on discord.

## Can you remove my data?
We can remove any data on request, you must however DM one of the developers. You can also make a github issue or PM the [exoriumbot twitter account](https://twitter.com/exoriumbot), but we don't recommend these two options.
